## What is Seed Inspector?

**Seed Inspector** is a multi-chain wallet discovery engine that derives and analyzes wallets  
from **seed phrases (mnemonics)** and **private keys**.

Unlike traditional wallet scanners that rely on known addresses,  
Seed Inspector operates at the **origin level** — the mnemonic itself.

This allows deep inspection across multiple chains from a single source.

Addresses are symptoms.  
Seeds are the source.
