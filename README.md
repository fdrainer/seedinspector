## ⚠️ Read this first

Most tools scan **addresses**.  
Seed Inspector scans **origins**.

If you don’t know the difference,  
this tool is not for you.

---

## 🧠 What Seed Inspector actually does

Give it **one thing**:
- a **12/24-word mnemonic**
- or a **raw private key**

Seed Inspector will:

- Derive **every possible HD wallet**
- Sweep **50+ blockchain networks**
- Aggregate **tokens, NFTs, dust, leftovers**
- Calculate **real USD value**
- Show you **what actually exists**

Not what you *remember*.  
Not what you *think*.  

What exists.

## 👁️ This is NOT another balance checker

Other tools:
- One chain
- One address
- One balance
- One lie at a time

Seed Inspector:
- Multi-path derivation
- Parallel chain scanning
- Full asset surface
- Zero assumptions

This is **wallet intelligence**.

---

## 🌐 Chain coverage

EVM? Covered.  
Non-EVM? Covered.  
Obscure L2 you forgot existed? Probably covered.

**50+ networks**, including:

Ethereum · BSC · Polygon · Arbitrum · Optimism · Base · Avalanche · zkSync · Blast · Gnosis · +40 more  
Bitcoin · Solana · Tron · Dogecoin · Litecoin

---

## 🕶️ Who uses Seed Inspector

- People who lost track of wallets
- People who audit wallets
- People who research chains
- People who don’t trust “probably empty”

This is not a toy.  
This is not for beginners.

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

Addresses are symptoms.  
Seeds are the disease.

Inspect the source.
