## What is Seed Inspector?
> A research-oriented engine focused on mnemonic-origin wallet analysis.

**Seed Inspector** is a multi-chain wallet discovery engine that derives and analyzes wallets  
from **seed phrases (mnemonics)** and **private keys**.

Unlike traditional wallet scanners that rely on known addresses,  
Seed Inspector operates at the **origin level** — the mnemonic itself.

This allows deep inspection across multiple chains from a single source.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Mnemonic-based HD wallet derivation  
- Private key scanning  
- Multi-chain asset discovery  
- Real balance aggregation (USD valuation)  
- Cross-network visibility from a single input  

Supported networks include **Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron**, and **50+ chains**.
